# Rock-Paper-Scissors
simple implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game in Python
Here's how the code works:

The play_game() function first prompts the player to choose between rock, paper, or scissors, and validates their input to make sure it's one of those three choices.

It then randomly generates a choice for the computer, using the random.choice() function to choose between rock, paper, or scissors.

It then prints out the choices of the player and computer, and determines the winner based on the classic rock-paper-scissors rules.

The code then enters a loop that lets the player continue playing the game as many times as they want. 

After each game, it prompts the player to see if they want to play again, and breaks out of the loop if they don't.
